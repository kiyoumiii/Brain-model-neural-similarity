Due to the presence of excessively long texts in xsum, there may be issues with insufficient GPU memory when processing with T5. The xsum dataset used in T5 is a truncated version of the datasets used by BART and PEGASUS, which removes any articles with more than 3000 tokens. And the indices of the deleted articles in the datasets used by BART and PEGASUS are recorded in the delete_index.csv file.
