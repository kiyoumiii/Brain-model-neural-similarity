Administrators of the ACT test took the decision just hours before some 5,500 students were due to sit it. The ACT is one of two entrance exams available to international and domestic students wanting to go to a US college. This is not the first cheating scandal to hit the tests in East Asia. The other entrance exam - the SAT - was cancelled in South Korea in 2013 because some of the questions were leaked. The ACT test was due to be held at 56 test centres in both South Korea and Hong Kong on Saturday morning. The Associated Press said teachers at some of Seoul's private "cram schools" said they were not notified until about an hour before the students were due to sit the test. ACT Inc, an Iowa-based non-profit organisation that was operating the test, said it took the decision after receiving "credible evidence that test materials intended for administration in these regions have been compromised". The organisation said in a statement that all students would get a refund but would only be able to resit when the tests are held again in September.
The shooting occurred at a hostel attached to the private Pragati Residential School in Bangalore city. Police say the alleged gunman, identified as Mahesh, was working as an office assistant in the school. Incidents of gun crime at schools and colleges in India are very rare. It is not clear what prompted the shooting. Police said on Thursday that Mahesh had been remanded until 12 April. Mahesh is alleged to have barged into the room of 18-year-old Gautami and shot her in the head with a pistol on on Tuesday evening. He then shot another student, Sirisha, who suffered severe injuries but is believed to be out of danger, say police. He was arrested on Wednesday after a manhunt. India has strict control laws, although a large number of feuds are settled with firearms. In 2007, a 14-year-old schoolboy was shot dead by two fellow students at a school campus near the capital, Delhi. 
The charity said tests confirmed all of the cats near Victor Avenue, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, had ingested the toxic substance. In the most recent case, seven-month-old Meereen died on Monday. An RSPCA spokesman said it was unclear whether the poisonings were accidental or deliberate. Updates on this story and more from LeicestershireThree other cats in the area have died in the last seven days, while another cat died two weeks ago. Meereen's "devastated" owner, Adria Pearce, said the cat came home on Friday evening and "seemed to be shivering a little". "I haven't been able to stop crying since she died," she said. "We found her behind the sofa, where she was foaming from the mouth and trying to be sick. "Meereen was taken to the vets - where it was confirmed she had consumed antifreeze - and died three days later.

The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday. They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash. The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal. Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper. Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area. He added: "There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found the number had gone up by 200 million since 2013. There has been a big problem with plastic carrier bags in the last few years, many of them can't be recycled and are often thrown away after they have been used. The bags end up in rubbish dumps and even rivers causing big problems for the environment. From October people in England will have to pay 5p for their plastic bags in a bid to encourage them to reuse the ones that they already have. Supermarkets in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, where people are charged for carrier bags, have all seen a decrease in bags used. Campaigners are hoping the charge in England will lessen the amount of bags being thrown away, helping the environment.
The victim was queuing for food at the branch in St George's Street, Canterbury at about 02:15 GMT on Friday when the assault occurred. Investigating officers said three men entered the restaurant and began being noisy and bumping into people. It is believed one of the group then set light to the woman's hair. Officers have released CCTV images of three men they are keen to speak to regarding the attack. Det Sgt Barry Carr said: "Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse. "This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible.

The Reds, who are fifth in National Two South, beat third-placed Chinnor 29-12 for a second win in a row. "Tommy Phillips, Ben Priddey and Craig Williams really led the team from the front," Churcher told BBC Cornwall. "If your front row and front five are making 70-plus tackles in a game you're going to be doing well and that's what happened against Chinnor. "The Reds face seven teams who are below them in the table in their next eight games, as well as league leaders Old Elthamians. Churcher believes his side still has a lot of room for improvement, adding: "Chinnor wasn't the complete performance, but emotionally it was a really dogged performance. "We've got to build on what we did last weekend, because if we don't, last weekend will have been a waste of time.
